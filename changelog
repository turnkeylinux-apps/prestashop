  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):

      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]

      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.

      as turnkey-ssl). Refactor relevant scripts to leverage turnkey-ssl.

    - Misc packaging changes/improvements.

  * Security hardening & improvements:
    - Generate and use new TurnKey Bookworm keys.
    - Automate (and require) default pinning for packages from Debian
      backports. Also support non-free backports.

    - Adminer (only on LAMP based apps) listen on IPv6.
    - Nginx/NodeJS (NodeJS based apps only) listen on IPv6.

  * Misc bugfixes & feature implementations:

    - Include zstd compression support.
    - Enable new non-free-firmware apt repo by default.
