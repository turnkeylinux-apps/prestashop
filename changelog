  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):

      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]

      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.

    - Misc packaging changes/improvements.

  * Security hardening & improvements:
    - Generate and use new TurnKey Bookworm keys.
    - Automate (and require) default pinning for packages from Debian
      backports. Also support non-free backports.

    - Nginx/NodeJS (NodeJS based apps only) listen on IPv6.

    - Include zstd compression support.
    - Enable new non-free-firmware apt repo by default.
