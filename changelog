    [ Stefan Davis ]

  * Adjust permissions as per Prestashop dashboard recommendation.

  * Adjust some PHP config defaults (memory_limit, post_size_max &
    upload_max_filesize) as recommended by Prestashop. Note docs also

    default (1000).

    Prestashop devs.

    TurnKey releases supported TLS 1.2, but could fallback as low as TLSv1).

  * Update SSL/TLS cyphers to provide "Intermediate" browser/client support
    (suitable for "General-purpose servers with a variety of clients,
    recommended for almost all systems"). As provided by Mozilla via
    https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/.

  * Updated all relevant Debian packages to Buster/10 versions; including
    PHP 7.3.

  * Updated version of mysqltuner script - now installed as per upstream
    recommendation.
